# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch

jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo `date` > $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/timestamp

      - uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v5
        with:
          add: timestamp
        


    # The local path to the directory where your repository is located. You should use actions/checkout first to set it up
    # Default: '.'
    cwd: '$GITHUB_WORKSPACE'

    # The message for the commit
    # Default: 'Commit from GitHub Actions (name of the workflow)'
    message: 'add timestamp'

    # The flag used on the pull strategy
    # Default: '--no-rebase'
